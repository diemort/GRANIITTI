Q:  Integrated cross section seems very high?
A:  Turn on screening integral (pomeron loop). The effect can be
    very high, depending on the process. Also, take care of branching
    ratios and phase space volumes (see below).


Q:  How do I choose the final state?
A:  After the '->' arrow, write down the final state in terms of PDG
    numbers such as '22 22' or their names such as 'gamma gamma'.
    Events are distributed according to the phase space in the case
    no amplitude is explicitly constructed for that particular
    decay. Any (cascade) final state is possible wihin phase space.


Q:  How do I know the PDG numbers/names?
A:  Write down something (dummy) after the '->' arrow,
    and try to generate. You will get a list of all particles.


Q:  What are '<C>' and '<F>' phase space classes?
A:  Different ways to organize phase space sampling.
    With equivalent generation+fiducial cuts, they produce
    identical results. However, the (other) one can be faster
    or more numerically stable with difficult amplitudes.


Q:  What are '->' versus '&>' operators?
A:  The '->' uses full 2->N phase space volume in the cross section
    integration. The &> operator (with <F> phase space) decouples
    the central system phase space, and the process will be
    [2->3] + [unweighted 1->(N-2) decays]. Thus, &> operator is
    useful to use with isolated resonance processes, for example
    yy[Higgs]<F>. Try it out and see the output!


Q:  What do generation cuts versus fiducial cuts mean?
A:  Generation cuts are applied at the level of phase space sampling,
    completely necessary. Fiducial cuts are applied after the event
    kinematics has been constructed - this is optional.
