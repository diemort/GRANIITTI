Q:  This is a beta version.


Q:  Integrated cross section seems very high?
A:  Turn on screening integral (pomeron loop).
    The effect can be very high, depending on the process.


Q:  How do choose the final state?
A:  After -> arrow, write down the final state in terms of PDG
    numbers such as '22 22' or their names such as 'gamma gamma'.
    Events are distributed according to the phase space, in the case
    if no amplitude is explicitly constructed for that particular
    decay. Any (cascade) final state is possible wihin phase space.


Q:  What are <C> and <F> phase space classes?
A:  Different ways to organize phase space sampling.
    With equivalent generation+fiducial cuts, they produce identical
    results. However, one can be faster or more numerically stable
    with difficult amplitudes, than the other one.


Q:  What are -> versus &> operators?
A:  The -> uses full 2->N phase space volume in the cross section
    integration. The &> operator (with <F> phase space) decouples
    the central system phase space, and the process will be
    [2->3] + [unweighted 1->(N-2) decays].
    Thus, &> operator is useful to use with isolated resonance
    processes, for example yy[Higgs]<F>. Try it out and see the output!
