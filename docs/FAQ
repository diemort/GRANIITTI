Q:  This is a beta version.

Q:  Integrated cross section seems very high?
A:  Turn on screening integral (pomeron loop).

Q:  What are <C> and <F> phase space classes?
A:  Different ways to organize phase space sampling.
    With equivalent generation+fiducial cuts, they produce identical
    results. However, one can be faster or more numerically stable
    with difficult amplitudes, than the other one.

Q:  What are -> versus &> operators?
A:  The -> uses full 2->N phase space volume in the cross section
    integration. The &> operator (with <F> phase space) decouples
    the central system phase space, and the process will be
    [2->3] + [unweighted 1->(N-2) decays].
    Thus, &> operator is useful to use with isolated resonance
    processes, for example yy[Higgs]<F>. Try it out and see the output!
