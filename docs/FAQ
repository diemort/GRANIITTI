First run ./bin/gr


Q:  It does not compile.
A:  If you use MACOSX, try to obtain the latest GCC toolchain.
    The software is being tested and developed on Ubuntu linux (+ ROOT 6).


Q:  Which features or processes are "under construction"?
A:  See /docs/UNDERWORK or send email.


Q:  Where are the examples of .json steering cards?
A:  Under /tests/processes folder. Make a copy to /input and modify.


Q:  Hey, for the analysis purposes, I just want to generate J=0 with a smooth
    invariant mass distribution and peripheral (exponential) t-distributions.
A:  Add @FLATAMP:X at the end of your process string with X = 1,2,3,... (try them out).
    For the b-slope parameter, adjust /modeldata/TUNE/GENERAL.json.


Q:  Integrated cross section seems very high?
A:  Turn on the screening integral (Pomeron loop). The effect can be
    very high, depending on the process - less for gamma-gamma processes.
    Also, take care of the branching ratios and phase space volumes (see below).


Q:  Are the soft central production parameters independent of the screening loop.
A:  NO. Strictly speaking one should have two sets of parameters (or tunes),
    one for the screening turned on, one without.
    Or just one, always screening turned on (computationally very demanding, though).


Q:  How well are the soft parameters tuned/fitted?
A:  The soft central production amplitude parameters are such that an approximate
    match with LHC data can be obtained. More high precision, fully exclusive
    but also semi-exclusive (proton dissociative) data is needed. The same
    words also for the PDG resonance branching ratios, which are not too well known
    in all cases (see /modeldata/BRANCHING.json). Elastic "eikonal pomeron"
    parameters are tuned with better accuracy to high energy elastic dsigma/dt.
    Low energy data seems to require additional parametrizations.


Q:  MC integral does not converge (stat. error estimate is very high)!
A:  This can happen if the generation cuts are too loose, the process
    is localized into spesific regime of the phase space and VEGAS
    cannot find suitable binning -> manually tighten up the generation cuts.
    For example, if you generate an isolated resonance with mass M,
    use '<F>' phase space and put the mass boundaries around the
    resonance peak M +- N full widths.


Q:  How do I choose the final state?
A:  After the '->' arrow, write down the final state in terms of PDG
    numbers such as '22 22' or their names such as 'gamma gamma'.
    Events are distributed according to the phase space in the case
    no amplitude is explicitly constructed for that particular
    decay. Any (cascade) final state is possible within the phase space.
    For example '-> A > {A1 > {A11 A12} A2 A3} B > {B1 B2 > {B21 B22} B3}'.


Q:  How do I know the PDG numbers/names?
A:  Write down something (dummy) after the '->' arrow,
    and try to generate. You will get a list of all particles.


Q:  What are '<C>' and '<F>' phase space classes?
A:  Different ways to organize phase space sampling.
    With equivalent generation+fiducial cuts, they should produce
    identical results. However, the (other) one can be faster
    or more numerically stable with difficult amplitudes. In general,
    we recommend '<C>' for continuum / continuum+resonance processes
    and '<F>' for isolated resonances and high final state leg continuum processes.


Q:  What are '->' versus '&>' operators?
A:  The '->' uses full 2->N phase space volume in the cross section
    integration. The &> operator (with '<F>' phase space) decouples
    the central system phase space, and the process will be
    [2->3] + [unweighted 1->(N-2) decays]. Thus, the '&>' operator is
    useful to use with isolated resonance processes, for example
    'yy[Higgs]<F>'. Be careful, however, one should not use it without care.


Q:  What do generation cuts versus fiducial cuts mean?
A:  Generation cuts are applied at the level of phase space sampling
    kinematic construction, completely necessary. Fiducial cuts are
    applied after the event kinematics has been constructed - this is optional.


Q:  Something seems just weird.
A:  Just send email, it might a bug.
