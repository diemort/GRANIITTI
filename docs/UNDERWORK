Processes under construction/validation:

- forward excitation is now implemented also for gamma-gamma (via F2 structure functions) but not fully validated
- tensor pomeron amplitudes for 2xPS,2xV,2xF implemented but not fully validated
- "sliding helicity amplitudes" under implementation
- vetocuts are not activated
- exhaustive unit testing of kinematics and dynamics, and consistency tests under implementation
