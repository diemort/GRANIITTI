Processes under construction/validation:

- tensor pomeron amplitudes for 2xPS,2xV,2xF implemented but not fully validated
- tensor pomeron amplitudes for S,PS,T resonances implemented. S,PS working, T not yet.
- forward excitation is now implemented also for gamma-gamma (via F2 structure functions) but not fully validated
- "sliding regge helicity amplitudes" under implementation
- perturbative meson pair (higher mass) continuum under construction
- vetocuts are not activated


Known problems:
- Looping processes in sequencies with different LHAPDF sets causes crash (in ./bin/exloop) 
  -> single instances of ./bin/gr not affected, ./bin/xscan perhaps. Something to do with LHAPDF memory access.
