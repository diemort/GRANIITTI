Algorithms under construction

- Fully automated spherical harmonics inverse expansion nearly fully implemented

Processes under construction/validation:

- tensor pomeron amplitudes for 2xPS,2xV,2xF implemented but not fully validated
- tensor pomeron amplitudes for S,PS,T resonances implemented. S,PS working, T not yet.
- forward excitation is now implemented also for gamma-gamma (via F2 structure functions) but not fully validated
- "sliding regge helicity amplitudes" under implementation
- perturbative meson pair (higher mass) continuum under construction
- vetocuts are not activated
- exhaustive unit testing of kinematics and dynamics, and consistency tests under implementation

- a known problem with creating & destroying MGraniitti() instances in a loop with LHAPDF access.
  If the PDFset is different -> faulty results. No effect for single ./gr instance.
  Something to do with LHAPDF library memory model & its use here.
