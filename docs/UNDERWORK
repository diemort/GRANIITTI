-----------

Processes & features under validation/implementation:

- tensor pomeron decay structures [f2 -> VV, 2xV -> 2x(2xPS)]
- perturbative (Durham QCD) meson pair (higher mass) continuum

Processes & features under construction

- "sliding" Regge helicity amplitudes (helicity trajectories)

Missing features:

- vetocuts are not activate for minbias processes

Known problems:
- Looping processes in sequencies with different LHAPDF sets causes crash (in ./bin/exloop) 
  -> single instances of ./bin/gr not affected, ./bin/xscan perhaps. Something to do with LHAPDF memory access.
