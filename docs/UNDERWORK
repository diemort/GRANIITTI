GRANIITTI UNDERWORK: 1.10.2019

-----------


Processes & features under validation/implementation:

- tensor pomeron chained decay structures [f2 -> VV, 2xV -> 2x(2xPS)]
- perturbative (Durham QCD) meson pair (higher mass) continuum


Processes & features under construction/feasibility inspection

- "sliding" Regge helicity amplitudes (helicity trajectories)
- in forward excitation, the "partonic beam-split" for PYTHIA could be useful?


Known problems

- ./bin/analyze may throw memory dump after exit, unknown ROOT problem probably with smart pointers

- Looping MGraniitti() in sequencies with different LHAPDF sets or otherwise different json input
  causes crash in ./bin/xscan, sounds like a memory problem?
  Single instances of ./bin/gr launched from commandline is safe from this bug.
