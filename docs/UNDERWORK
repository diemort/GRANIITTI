-----------

Processes & features under validation:

- tensor pomeron amplitudes for 2xPS,2xV,2xF implemented
- tensor pomeron amplitudes for S,PS,V,T resonances implemented
- forward excitation is implemented also for gamma-gamma (via F2 structure functions)
- perturbative (Durham QCD) meson pair (higher mass) continuum

Processes & features under implementation

- "sliding" Regge helicity amplitudes (helicity trajectories)

Missing features:

- vetocuts are not activate for minbias processes

Known problems:
- Looping processes in sequencies with different LHAPDF sets causes crash (in ./bin/exloop) 
  -> single instances of ./bin/gr not affected, ./bin/xscan perhaps. Something to do with LHAPDF memory access.
