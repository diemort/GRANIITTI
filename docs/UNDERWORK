GRANIITTI UNDERWORK: 30.08.2019

-----------


Processes & features under validation/implementation:

- tensor pomeron decay structures [f2 -> VV, 2xV -> 2x(2xPS)]
- perturbative (Durham QCD) meson pair (higher mass) continuum


Processes & features under construction/feasibility inspection

- "sliding" Regge helicity amplitudes (helicity trajectories)
- in forward excitation, the "partonic beam-split" for PYTHIA could be useful


Missing features:

- vetocuts are not activate for minbias processes


Known problems:
- ./bin/analyze may throw memory dump after exit, harmless ROOT problem
- Looping processes in sequencies with different LHAPDF sets causes crash (in ./bin/exloop) 
  -> single instances of ./bin/gr not affected, ./bin/xscan perhaps. Something to do with LHAPDF memory access.
