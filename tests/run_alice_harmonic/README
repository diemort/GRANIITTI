RULES:
-------

1.) The reference phase space sample needs to be flat angular distributed in the system rest frame.
Thus, we make cut only on the system rapidity. No cut on _system_ rapidity/mass/any system variable
will affect the spin-0 decay distribution, by Lorentz invariance.

System cuts:
|Y| < 0.9

2.) Test process is generated with the same system cuts as the reference sample.
No fiducial cuts at this point.

System cuts:
As in 1.)

3.) Fiducial cuts are ONLY applied inside fitspherical. Thus, we can see exactly how well
the (spherical moment mixing) inversion works. Real data has, by far, the largest effective
fiducial cuts applied already by the detector geometry.

Fiducial cuts:
|eta(pi)| < 0.8
pt(pi)    > 0.1


This formulation is mathematically rigorous.
